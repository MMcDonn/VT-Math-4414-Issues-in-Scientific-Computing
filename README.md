#Issues in Scientific Computing Project Write-Ups and Code

This repository contains code that I have written and/or adapted from class
lectures. There are two PDFs in the repository which contain the write-up for 
the first project in the course. The second PDF contains only the work that I
contributed to a group project.

The majority of the code is functions with a few scripts  for homework that I was mindful enough to save throughout the semester.
